# CodeQuizUpdated

This is a coding quiz challenge given to us to test our skills to see if we could create a randomized test. I specialized this test around a superhero theme as you could probably tell once you hit start. This application is designed to test users knowledge on Marvel superheroes. It does this by prompting users different questions, taking in their score, and showing them the results of how many questions they may have answered correctly.
